# Robustness
*Unifying framework for evaluating robustness of pairwise comparison methods against rank reversal*
 
Just run robustness.py (depends on config.py) in order to replicate the results from
*Jan Gorecki, David Bartl and Jaroslav Ramik (2023). Robustness of methods calculating priority 
vectors from pairwise comparison matrices against rank reversal: A probabilistic concept*.
