# Robustness
*Unifying Python framework for evaluating robustness of pairwise comparison methods against rank reversal*
 
Just run robustness.py (depends on config.py) in order to replicate the results from
*Jan Gorecki, David Bartl and Jaroslav Ramik (2023).  Robustness of methods for calculating priority 
vectors from pairwise comparison matrices against rank reversal: A probabilistic approach. (under reviews)*

If one does not want to compute all the results but wants to replicate the plots,
just switch the value of argument load_results to True in replicate(), and the precomputed 
results from the folder *results* will be used.
